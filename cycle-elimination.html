    <h1>Cycle Elimination Algorithm</h1>

    <p>Cycle Elimination Algorithm is a fair division algorithm that outputs an EF-1 Allocation in polynomial time complexity.</p>  

    <h2>Algorithm</h2>
    <p>
      The algorithm is as follows: 
      <ol>
        <li>Fix ordering of the goods.</li>
        <li>While ∃ unallocated goods:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>find a node j with in-degree = 0, i.e. find an agent that no one envies, allocated the good to that agent.</li>
            <li>if there doesn’t exist a node with node with in-degree = 0, then this implies there exists a cycle in envy graph, in such case, rotate the bundles among the agents along the cycle, and hence by definition cycle will be removed.
            </li>
          </ol>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Note</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>An envy graph is a directed graph with agents as vertices, and directed
        edge from a<sub>i</sub> to a<sub>j</sub> represents that a<sub>i</sub> envies a<sub>j</sub>.</li>
      <li>At every step of the algorithm, the allocation is EF-1. Since we allocate good to an agent which no one envies at every step, then if we remove that good, the allocation is EF-1 with respect to that good.</li>
    </ul>
